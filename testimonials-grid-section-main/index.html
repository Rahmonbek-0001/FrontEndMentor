            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
            been looking to make a <br />
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
            here. I signed up for <br />
            the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
            shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br />
            weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I’ve <br />
            successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
            VR startup. ”

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br />
        never written a line of code. I needed <br />
        some structure from professionals <br />
        who can help me learn programming <br />
        step by step. I was encouraged to <br />
        enroll by a former student of theirs <br />
        who can only say wonderful things <br />
        about the program. The entire <br />
        curriculum and staff did not <br />
        disappoint. They were very hands-on <br />
        and I never had to wait long for <br />
        assistance. The agile team project, in <br />
        particular, was outstanding. It took <br />
        my learning to the next level in a way <br />
        that no tutorial could ever have. In <br />
        fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br />
        interviews as an example of my <br />
        developent experience. It certainly <br />
        helped me land a job as a full-stack <br />
        developer after receiving multiple <br />
        offers. 100% recommend! ”
